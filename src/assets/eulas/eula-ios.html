  THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND EPICOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND
  ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR

  ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. EPICOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR
